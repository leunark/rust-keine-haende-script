# rust-keine-haende-script
This AHK script was made to compensate recoil in a survival game. It comes with accurate functions that can manipulate cursors movement. By analysing a weapons pattern, you can compensate it by predicting the pattern and moving always to the opposite direction of the weapons recoil. Of course, those functions can be used for similiar behavior in other games or different scenarios.

Bear in mind that this script is outdated. The recoil pattern changed, but it can easily be updated.
