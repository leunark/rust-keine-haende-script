# rust-keine-haende-script
This AHK script was made to compensate recoil in the game Rust. It comes with accurate functions that can manipulate cursors movement. By analysing a weapons pattern, you can compensate it by predicting the pattern and moving always to the opposite direction of the weapons recoil. Of course, those functions can be used for similiar behavior in other games or different scenarios.
